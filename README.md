# Semantic-Model-Evaluator
Given a tagged dataset, evaluate the performance of different semantic search models for interpreting your data.
This is helpful when working with strangely formatted data which semantic search models may behave unusually on. 
It allows you to find a model that works for your data see https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html

REQUIREMENTS:

    A dataset formatable as a pandas dataframe.
  
    a tagged dataset exported from Doccano as a jsonl file see https://github.com/doccano/doccano
